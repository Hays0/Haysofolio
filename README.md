This site is made by me with assitance of an AI algorithm to help me learn to code websites.
The more complex codes are made by ai. They are however explained to me what they do. 

I am practicing programing/coding before university starts to help me in my course in the future. I have exactly a year to work on website coding skills. 

I would appreciate my code not to be taken, but even then I either won't care or won't notice. So do whatever the diddly squat you want.
